<h1>#83: FOURTH OF JULY IN BOSTON</h1>
<h3><strong>AMERICA WAS INVENTED IN MASSACHUSETTS.</strong></h3>

<p>The Fourth of July is one of those rare occasions on which it is entirely acceptable (and even encouraged) to wear head-to-toe Americana apparel. Which means July 4th is already an awesome day. And because Boston is pretty much the whole reason America exists (or so say residents), Fourth of July in Boston is unbeatable. Here’s how to celebrate in Beantown:</p>

<p><b>FOR HISTORY BUFFS: </b>The day starts out with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall Plaza. Follow the parade to the Granary Burial Ground, where wreaths are laid on the tombstones of America’s most beloved patriots. Stick around the Old State House for a while to hear a reading of the Declaration of Independence. Best to do this with your aged grandfather, who will pretend like he clearly remembers the day it was originally read…in July 1776. </P>

<p><b>FOR FAMILIES:</b> Boston Harborfest takes place the entire week of Fourth of July, which means a plethora of Freedom Trail/citywide tours, dinner cruises aboard the USS Constitution, whale watching opportunities at the Aquarium, and general festivities and music concerts at the City Hall Plaza. Choose your preferred energy level, number of children, historical significance, and time of day to find your perfect match. </p>

<p><b>FOR WALLFLOWERS:</b> If you’re not up to braving the crowds in Boston, you can enjoy the fireworks from the Cambridge side of the Charles River (although there were still be a number of spectators to deal with other there, too).</p>

<p>Whatever you choose to do, you can’t not get into the patriotic spirit pulsing through one of America’s oldest and most historic cities.</p>
